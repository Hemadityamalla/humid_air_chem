# Chemistry repo for humid air discharge simulations

## Started with the following files, made by Behnaz:
- 98air_2water_chemistry_old.txt: This contains the humid air chemistry with 2% water vapour in the gas composition.
- Dry_air_chemistry_old.txt: This is the file without any water molecule reactions

## To do:
- Add reactions related to RONS. 
- (WHAT ELSE?)
